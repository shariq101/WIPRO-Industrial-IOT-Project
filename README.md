The best friend of a lost coal miner is data and environment parameters around, these are minimum requisite to sustain the life if you are lost in the mine .

We are creating a smart wearable solution that can be the big new step for the worker safety in the mining industry.

The proposal is that we will divide the whole area in the mine into various sector and at each sector there will be very high frequency reception antennas and the wearables will be always communicating with these antennas and giving the pre-danger notifications.

The technologies used in the wearable are:

RFIDS 
NRF24L01
MQ7 Sensors
and other atmospheric sensors
